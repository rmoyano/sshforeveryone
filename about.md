SSH for everyone.
=======
## SSH (Secure Shell) tutorial.

###Purpose
These work is a draft in continous development, the original idea was to serve as a guide using SSH protocol and their related tools because I could not find a comprehensive tutorial. With the passage of time and a lot a patience, I will be writing new chapters until we get a complete guide.
